The above rotating displays are swept out by flat surfaces. However in another class of volumetric displays, the viewing volume is swept out by a curved surface. The shapes of such displays can be spherical spirals or helical.

Recently, rotating swept displays have been developed to use light fields to display different imagery to each viewing angle. The benefit of such displays is that they can produce viewpoint dependent rendering effects, such as shading, and hidden surface removal. However, such displays are not truly volumetric, as the perceived location of a voxel might not be the actual location where it is emitted.

Rotating volumetric displays are one of the more promising technologies to date, with current implementations being available commercially. This is the technology we use in this thesis.

### 2.3.3 Static Volumetric Displays

Static volumetric displays are defined as displays which generate light in true 3D space, without the need for mechanical motion. With this technique, emissive voxels are provided at a large number of locations in a static setup, without the use of oscillating or rotating mirrors or screens. This can be accomplished by exciting a plasma filled medium within a display volume to produce a glow at a single point.

A proof-of-concept of this displays was implemented in 1971, where two faint spots of light were generated inside a transparent crystal of erbium-doped calcium fluoride, with the use of filtered xenon lamps as excitation sources.

Based on this early work, Downing et al. presented a three-color static volumetric display with improved material using high powered laser diodes. The laser beams intersect inside a transparent volume, which consists of a rare earth-doped heavy metal fluoride glass. Red, green, and blue voxels can be illuminated by sequential two-step resonant absorption. Imagery can be produced in 3D by scanning the point of intersection of the lasers in various 3D locations of the volume. The demonstrated work was implemented in a prototype sugar-cube sized volume.
