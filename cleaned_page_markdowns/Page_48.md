environments is clearly relevant. A number of researchers have proposed and agreed upon four fundamental tasks for 3D interactions: navigation (or travel), selection, manipulation, and system control. In this section we summarize the interactions techniques which have been developed in each of these categories.

## 2.6.1 Navigation

Navigation refers to the task of positioning and orienting the viewpoint within a 3D environment. Because the environment size displayed within a volumetric display is limited to the size of its enclosure, users will be able to effectively control their viewpoint orientation and position by simply changing the position of their head. As a result, the navigation techniques developed for vast large virtual environments, where changing the viewpoint position may require significant travel distances, will be less applicable, in comparison to the other three fundamental tasks, so we online give a brief outline of them here.

### 2.6.1.1 Cinematic Camera Metaphor

In non-immersive 3D environments, such as 3D graphics and animation programs, mouse movements coupled with modifier keys are generally used to manipulate the position of the virtual camera, which in turn controls the userâ€™s viewpoint of the scene. This is generally termed as a cinematic camera metaphor, since the user can tumble, track and dolly a viewpoint. The Unicam allows users to manipulate the position of the 3D camera using a mouse and only a single button, coupled with different gestures for invoking camera functionality. The StyleCam allows authors to significantly tailor the best possible camera positions and paths to be used by a viewer.

Various metaphors for viewpoint motion and control in 3D environments, which use higher degree-of-freedom input, have also been proposed. Ware and Osborne explore 3 such metaphors which were implemented using a six degree-of-freedom input device which we now discuss.
