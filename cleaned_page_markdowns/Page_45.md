## 2.5.2 Roller mouse

A drawback of using the previously discussed six degree-of-freedom input devices is that they can be fatiguing to users. Unlike a mouse, a user cannot simply let go of the device, and have it maintain its position. To address this problem, 3D pointing devices have been developed, which are based on the standard 2D mouse, but enable 3D interactions. The “roller mouse” is a standard mouse with two wheels on the front, on either side of a single button. The wheels are fixed to a common axle so that they control a single degree-of-freedom. The roller mouse can be used to control a 3D cursor, by mapping the usual mouse movements to X and Y axis movements of the cursor, while mapping movement of the scroll-wheel to movement of the cursor along the Z axis.

## 2.5.3 Rockin’Mouse

The Rockin’Mouse is another example of a standard mouse which has been enhanced for added degrees of freedom. The Rockin’Mouse can move like a standard mouse, but its bottom is rounded, so that it can be tilted left and right, as well as forward and backwards, providing two additional degrees of freedom. In a 3D positioning task, it was shown that the Rockin’Mouse was 30% faster, when compared to a standard mouse.

Because the Rockin’Mouse and roller mouse operate the depth dimension by different behaviours and muscle groups from those which operate the X and Y dimensions, it may
