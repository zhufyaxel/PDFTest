volumetric display is particularly interesting, as the display does not have to be oriented to one particular user but rather can be accessed from all sides. This allows for natural and intuitive collaboration, as users can simply move around the display to get different perspectives or to interact with others.

When designing collaborative user interfaces for volumetric displays, several factors must be considered. The system needs to support multiple users in an unobtrusive manner, ensuring that their interactions do not interfere with each other. Also, it should facilitate communication between users, providing tools that enhance their ability to share and discuss the information displayed.

There are three primary areas to focus on when designing these interfaces:

1. **User Positioning and Interaction:** Ensuring that users have equal and effective access to the display, regardless of their position around it.

2. **Data Presentation and Manipulation:** Providing intuitive methods for users to interact with the data, including navigation, selection, and modification.

3. **Collaboration Support:** Developing features that support communication and coordination between users, such as annotation tools, shared cursors, or highlighting mechanisms.

In the following sections, we will delve into these areas, examining existing research and identifying best practices for the development of collaborative user interfaces for volumetric displays.
