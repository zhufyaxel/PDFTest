With the zooming technique, the non-dominant hand controls a focus point, while the dominant hand controls the zoom factor. For rotation about an axis, the non-dominant hand defines an axis, while the dominant hand controls the rotation. A “steering wheel” rotation technique was also used, where both hands could grab the model and spin it.

### 2.7.6 Neurosurgical Planning

Hinckley et al. designed a user interface for three-dimensional neurosurgical visualization. The interface was based on the manipulation of physical tools in free space. The interface was bimanual, with each hand being able to hold a tool. The interface allowed users to transfer their skills of manipulating tools with two hands.
