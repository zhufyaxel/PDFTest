## Text Layout and Orientation

One significant challenge with spatial collaboration is how text can be effectively displayed to multiple users. If users all have their own viewpoint of the shared physical area, then they will be viewing text from different angles. This could make text difficult, or sometimes impossible to read. For example, if two viewers of the volumetric display are standing 90ยบ apart from each other, then 2D text facing one user will be completely parallel and thus invisible to the other user. The role of orientation has been studied in collaborative settings and it has been agreed upon that elegant algorithms for the orientation of screen elements are required to avoid depriving the users of rich interaction.

On tabletop displays, there have been applications developed in which textual labels are oriented toward each participant. Kruger et al. present a thorough review of systems which attempt to dynamically and automatically re-orient objects. Wigdor and Balakrishnan present a study of the effects of text orientation on table top displays, which can guide interface designers as to when it is important for text to be re-oriented. They found that the effect of orientation on reading labels, numeric and textual data, and performing serial searches, was less dramatic than what might have been previously assumed. This shows that in some situations the designer need not worry about providing perfect orientations of all text to every user of a system.
