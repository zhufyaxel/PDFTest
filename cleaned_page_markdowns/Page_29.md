## 2.2 Three-Dimensional Display Technology

In this section we provide a background on the types of display technology which have been used to present three-dimensional data. These display techniques all utilize various depth cues which have been identified in psychological research on human perception. We now discuss the display techniques, and the associated cues which these displays provide.

### 2.2.1 Perspective Displays

A basic method for displaying three-dimensional environments, which is commonly used in 3D graphics, is to use a standard workstation monitor, using a perspective projection. Perspective displays utilize perspective and relative size cues, in which objects further away, produce smaller retinal images than closer objects. Perspective cues are particularly effective when parallel lines are displayed within the scene.

Another cue which is utilized in perspective displays is motion parallax, also referred to as the kinetic depth effect. With this cue, a sensation of depth is produced when an object moves in space relative to an observer. Therefore, interfaces should provide a mechanism for moving the viewpoint in a 3D scene.

By utilizing these two powerful depth cues, perspective displays are effective tools for viewing and interacting with three-dimensional data, and are still the most commonly employed display type for tasks such as 3D graphics design and animation.

### 2.2.2 Non-Immersive Stereoscopic Displays

An important depth cue which cannot be provided by a standard workstation monitor is stereopsis. This depth cue is produced from the binocular disparity when viewing 3D objects in natural environments. It can be particularly strong when the perceived objects are close to the viewer. To provide stereopsis, a system simply needs to
