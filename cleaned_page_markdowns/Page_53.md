## Silk Cursor

The Silk Cursor is a 3D volume cursor, evolving from 2D area cursors. It offers two benefits for selection tasks: enhanced target activation area, similar to 2D area cursors, and a semi-transparent, rectangular shape that helps users distinguish the relative position of targets—whether they are in front, inside, or behind it. Experiments showed its effectiveness in both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays.

## Go – Go Technique

Introduced by Poupyrev in 1996, the go-go selection technique is designed for selecting objects at a distance using a 3D cursor. It features a metaphor of extending the user’s arm. For close objects, the virtual hand corresponds with the real hand’s movement. To access distant objects, extending the hand beyond two-thirds the arm's length causes the virtual arm to grow non-linearly, facilitating the selection of distant objects beyond the normal reach.
