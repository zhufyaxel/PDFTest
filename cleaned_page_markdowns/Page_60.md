## Development of Selection, Manipulation, and System Control Techniques

As discussed in Section 2.6.5, a number of the techniques developed in the VR literature can be reused in volumetric displays. However, a fundamental difference from VR environments is that in volumetric displays, there is a physical barrier separating the user and the virtual data. As a result, many of the interaction techniques, such as direct grabbing and manipulation, will need to be modified, and new interactions techniques may be developed.

The motivation for the development of the techniques discussed in this section was to create an equivalent of the standard desktop GUI in a virtual environment. Our motivation will be similar, as we would like to develop the fundamental interaction techniques which could make up a fluid interface within a volumetric display.

## 2.7 Interactive Three-Dimensional Applications

The interaction techniques discussed in the previous section will provide valuable insights for the development of interaction techniques for volumetric displays. Once new techniques are developed for the volumetric display, the next challenge will be to integrate these techniques into single fluid applications, which can be used for specialized purposes. We now provide a survey of some interactive 3D applications which have been developed for various 3D display systems, which will provide inspiration for the development of interactive applications for volumetric displays.

### 2.7.1 Designing Surfaces in 3D

One of the earliest interactive 3D applications was an experimental system for designing surfaces in 3D, built by Clark in the 1970â€™s [Clark 1976]. It used a head-mounted display to provide a stereoscopic view, and the user interacted with the system using a three degree-of-freedom wand, which had its position tracked by three microfilament lines.
