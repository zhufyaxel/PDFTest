## Interaction Techniques in Image Plane

Pierce et al. explored several different image plane interaction techniques which use occlusion selection. These include:

1. **Head Crusher Technique**: Objects which lie between the userâ€™s index finger and thumb are selected.
2. **Sticky Finger Technique**: Objects are selected by occluding them with the tip of the index finger.
3. **Lifting Palm Technique**: Objects are selected by flattening the hand and positioning the palm underneath the object.
4. **Framing Hands Technique**: Both hands are used to define a bounding box around the object of interest, using the thumbs and index fingers.

### 3D Cursor for Interaction

A more direct method of interaction, using a 3D cursor that specifies X, Y, and Z coordinates has also been suggested. According to Mine, local interactions in a virtual world should use a direct mapping from the user's hand to the 3D cursor for selecting objects. For selecting objects at a distance, methods like laser beam or spotlight selection could be utilized. Additionally, a "virtual cursor or drone" could be maneuvered by the user throughout the environment until it reaches a target for selection.
