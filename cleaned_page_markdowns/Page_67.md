## 2.8.2 Collaborative Tabletop Displays

Collaborative tabletop applications are good examples of SDG and spatial collaboration, as the focus of interaction is on a single shared physical device. The following is a small sample of research in this area.

### 2.8.2.1 RoomPlanner

Wu and Balakrishnan developed RoomPlanner, a prototype application for furniture layout [Wu and Balakrishnan 2003]. The application runs on a DiamondTouch display [Dietz and Leigh 2001] which can sense multiple input points from multiple users. They present a suite of interaction technique based on multi-finger and whole-hand gesture interaction. They also incorporate techniques specifically relevant for spatial collaboration, such as creating and maintaining personal interaction spaces, sharing information with collaborators, and interacting with private data.

### 2.8.2.2 DiamondSpin

Shen et al. present a toolkit called DiamondSpin for experimentation with spatial collaboration on tabletop displays [Shen et al. 2004]. DiamondSpin allows for arbitrary orientation and positioning of documents on the display surface. The toolkit also supports various polygonal tabletop layouts, such as rectangular, octagonal, and circular. An important factor of the DiamondSpin is that it allows for multiple work areas, where multiple objects can be active concurrently, allowing for synchronous collaboration.
