## 2.7.2 3-Draw

Another system which is used to create 3D models is 3-Draw [Sachs et al. 1991]. The 3-Draw computer aided design tool is a tangible user interface for creating systems of 3D curves and editing them using deformations such as stretching, cutting, bending, and erasing. It is a two handed user interface. The non-dominant hand holds a thin rectangular plate with a six degree-of-freedom tracking device attached to it, and it is used to specify the viewing perspective. The dominant hand is used to point or draw 3D curves with a six degree-of-freedom stylus (Figure 2-17). A user can directly draw three-dimensional curves of a model as if the model were sitting on the plate that they are holding and positioning with their non-dominant hand. The user can also draw two dimensional curves to specify the shape of their curve and then specify its endpoints on an existing model. This allows an artist to use their sketching skills to accurately draw the shape of a curve, without worrying about its scale, placement, and orientation.

## 2.7.3 3DM

Butterworth developed a 3D modeling system called 3DM, which used a head mounted display to place the user inside the modeling space [Butterworth et al. 1992]. A six degree-of-freedom two-button mouse was used to interact with the system. Along with
