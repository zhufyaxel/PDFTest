## 2.6.5 Interaction Techniques for Volumetric Displays

Given that volumetric displays have not been easily available until recently, there has been relatively little research on how to use such displays effectively in an interactive manner. A speculative paper discusses possible interaction scenarios for volumetric displays, using wizard-of-oz mock-up prototypes to demonstrate various techniques for selection, displaying text and menus, and manipulating objects [Balakrishnan et al. 2001] (Figure 2-16). However, they did not have or make use of a real volumetric display and as such did not demonstrate any working implementations of their ideas. Some of the main conclusions of their research were as follows:

- **Physical rotation**: users were compelled to physically rotate the displays to get different views of the 3D content.
- **Touching the enclosure**: Users wanted to interact with internal objects by touching the surface of the displays as if it were a touch sensitive input device
- **Volume Management**: Given the realism of the displays, users wanted to manage the space inside with hand gestures which would be used to manage physical volumes
- **Viewpoint independent user interface widgets**: Since users are able to move around the displays, interface widgets should be available from any viewpoint.
- **Reuse**: Some input devices and interaction techniques from the VR literature transfer well to volumetric displays and should be reused. Other techniques require some enhancements and innovation so that they are appropriate for use on volumetric displays.

## 2.6.6 Summary

In this section we have presented a number of fundamental interaction techniques which have been developed for 3D environments. These interaction techniques are categorized as navigation, selection, manipulation, and system control. The navigation techniques will be of less relevance to volumetric displays, since there is a limited viewing volume, and users can easily change their viewpoint by physically moving. However, the
