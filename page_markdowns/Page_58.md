Bowman and Wingrave describe and compare three different menu techniques for virtual environments [Bowman and Wingrave 2001]. A floating menu was developed, in which the location of the menu is bound to the location of the userâ€™s head. The menu acts like a standard drop down menu, which can be navigated through using occlusions selection. The pen and tablet menu system places menus and widgets on the surface of a virtual tablet which corresponds to a physical surface which the user holds. A physical pen is held and controls a virtual stylus, which is used to interact with the tablet. TULIP menus require multiple-finger tracking, and binds different menu options to each finger. The user could select the options by pinching the thumb with the appropriate finger (Figure 2-15b). Of these three techniques, the pen and tablet menu was fastest, although users had a preference for the TULIP menu. Users also reported higher discomfort levels with the pen and tablet technique.
