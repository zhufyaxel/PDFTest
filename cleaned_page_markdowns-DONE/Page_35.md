appropriate position of the tube. Because of the high mass of the tube, it would be difficult to obtain the desirable rapid acceleration and deceleration at each end of its oscillation.

A more practical suggestion is to have the phosphorous screen within the CRT oscillate rather than the entire CRT itself. The screen is mounted within a vacuum tube behind a transparent viewing globe, and oscillates with a piston like motion. An electron gun illuminates the screen from the rear.

A variation of the oscillating screen, is to have an oscillating mirror from which a CRT image is viewed. The mirror moves such that the visual path length is swept periodically, and the CRT image apparently sweeps out the volume. The drawback of this scheme is that the viewing angle is limited to the reflective surface coverage.

Because of the inertial forces required for oscillating screens, this class of displays generally has problems with vibration and noise. The accelerations involved also limit the oscillation frequency, causing considerable flicker of the displayed images. A more promising approach is a rotating swept display, which we now discuss.

## Rotating Swept Volumetric Displays

One of the earliest implementations of rotating swept volumetric displays was developed by the ITT Laboratories in 1960, which consisted of a cathode ray tube whose light is optically transferred to a translucent rotating screen within a glass cylinder. The motor driven panel turned at approximately 20 revolutions per
