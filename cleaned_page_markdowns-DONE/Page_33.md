## 2.2.6 Chameleon

A less common technology for presenting 3D environments is the Chameleon system. With the Chameleon system, perspective images of three-dimensional scenes appear on a small display held in the palm of the hand. As with fish tank and head mounted displays the perspective view is continuously updated. However, the perspective viewpoint is determined by the position of the display, rather than being coupled with the head of the user.

The Chameleon approach is almost like using a magnifying glass which looks into a virtual scene, rather than the physical world. While the display does not provide the full immersive feeling or viewing angle of a cave or head mounted display, users can easily browse the scene by moving the lightweight display.

There have been other implementations of Chameleon displays. The boom chameleon consists of a flat-panel display mounted on a tracked mechanical boom. The armature of the boom is carefully balanced to allow the display to float weightlessly in space. The display acts as a physical window into 3D virtual environments, through which a one-to-one mapping between real and virtual space is preserved.

Chameleon systems can also have the ability to support augmented reality. Location tracking could be used to sense the context of its environment. For example, bringing the display close to a map could give additional information about the region that it was close to. Further augmentations included adding video cameras, allowing computer-generated information to be superimposed over a view of the physical world.
