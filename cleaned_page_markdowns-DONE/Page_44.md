## 2.5.1 Six Degree-of-Freedom Devices

Ware and Jessome explore the use of a free-space six degree-of-freedom device for a three-dimensional positioning task. They called the device a “bat”, as it is like a mouse which flies. The tracking device provides six degrees of freedom by sensing its x, y, and z positions, as well as its roll, pitch, and yaw. There are a number of commercially available implementations of such six degree-of-freedom tracking devices and they have been commonly used for interacting with virtual environments, as they can be used to directly manipulate the position and orientation of virtual objects. Frolich and Plate augmented a bat with 3 rods representing the principal axes, which could be pushed and pulled to specify constrained motion along the corresponding axis.

Zhai gives a detailed comparison of these isotonic devices, which can be moved freely in 3D space, to six degree-of-freedom isometric input devices. Isometric devices are mounted on a stationary surface, and sometimes termed “desktop devices”, and are like six degree-of-freedom joysticks. These devices are isometric as they all have some sort of spring loaded or elastic self-centering mechanism. Examples are the Spaceball™, SpaceMaster™ and SpaceMouse™. Zhai found that isotonic devices are much more appropriate for position control, while isometric devices are superior for rate control.
