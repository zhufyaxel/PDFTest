Another interesting input device which has been used for 3D interfaces is called ShapeTape™. ShapeTape™ is a curve input device, which senses the bend and twist along its entire length. Researchers have explored the use of such a high degree-of-freedom input device for the manipulation of curves and surfaces in 3D environments.

## 2.5.6 Summary

In this section we have provided an outline of the most common input devices used for interacting with 3D environments. Six degree-of-freedom devices can be used to provide direct manipulation of virtual objects, while enhancements to the mouse can also increase the number of degrees of freedom of an input device, while keeping some of the desirable properties of the mouse.

For added degrees of freedom, researchers have also looked at bimanual techniques, where the user can directly use both hands, or use both hands to hold physical tools. We have also seen how specialized high degree-of-freedom input devices can be used for both 2D and 3D interaction.

Because little research has been conducted on volumetric displays, no one has really explored what input devices should be used with these displays. It will be of interest to see which of these discussed input devices will be most appropriate for interacting with volumetric displays. We may find that the devices will need to be modified or enhanced. We may also find new methods of input, such as using the volumetric display’s enclosing surface as a touch sensitive input device.

While the choice of input device is interesting, this will only be a step in the direction of developing interactive user interfaces for volumetric displays. In the following sections, we will see the 3D interaction techniques and applications which have been developed using the input devices discussed in this section.

## 2.6 Three-Dimensional Interaction Techniques

Along with finding appropriate input devices for volumetric displays, we will be interested in finding effective interaction techniques for such displays. In exploring this topic, the vast literature on interaction within 3D user interfaces and virtual reality.
