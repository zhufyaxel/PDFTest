## Viewpoint Conditions, The Perspective View

For each trial of the experiment, subjects were given one of the 10 pairwise comparisons of the 5 viewing conditions. They toggled between the viewing conditions until they made their final selection on which was “best”. 

The results showed that users rarely preferred stereo without head coupling over head coupling without stereo. More frequently, users chose head coupling without stereo over head coupling with stereo 68% of the time, attributing this preference to the ghosting effect in the stereo conditions due to imperfect phosphor decay causing crosstalk between the left and right images.

The results supported the use of head coupled stereo viewing, with all subjects expressing their willingness to use it for object visualization if it were available.

## 2.4.2 Empirical Evaluation of Stereo and Motion Cues

Subjective evaluations of three-dimensional viewing modes indicate that providing stereo or motion cues improves the user’s perception of a three-dimensional scene. Quantitative measures have been attempted to determine the exact benefit of moving from 2D to 3D representations, though results depend on the specific tasks involved.

It has been demonstrated that stereoscopy enhances performance in detecting paths in a tree structure. Further reductions in errors were found when scene rotation was incorporated, which was system-controlled in the studies.
