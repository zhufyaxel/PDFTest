et al. [1993] found similar results when the motion was controlled by the user, in the form of a head coupled perspective view.

In one of the more recent studies, Ware and Franck [1996] evaluated nine different types of viewing modes for a path tracing task. Randomly generated graphs were presented, and users were required to determine if two highlighted nodes were connected by a path of length two. The viewing modes consisted of different combinations of perspective, stereo, and motion parallax cues, where they tested both hand, head, a system controlled rotation of the scene.

It was found that the stereo viewing mode without motion was significantly worse than all three tested stereo modes with motion, including system controlled rotation, hand coupled rotation, and head coupled rotation. Of the three viewing modes which combined stereo and motion, there were no significant differences, showing that the motion parallax cues were important, but it did not matter how they were provided.

In the virtual reality literature, researchers have attempted to quantify the benefits of immersion within virtual environments. Barfield et al. found that head tracking significantly improves usersâ€™ sense of presence [Barfield et al. 1997]. In a collaborative task, where two users had to maneuver a ring through a 3D object, Narayan et al. found that stereo was extremely important, while head tracking did not provide significant performance gains [Narayan et al. 2005].

### 2.4.3 Qualitative Evaluation of Volumetric Displays

Because volumetric displays are still in the developmental stages, little evaluation has been conducted to provide a quantitative comparison to other 3D viewing modes. However, qualitative benefits associated with their use have been reported. Balakrishnan et al. provide a good summary of these benefits, which we now discuss [Balakrishnan et al. 2001].

The fundamental difference is that volumetric displays generate images in true 3D space, so imagery can be viewed within the displays, just as one would view real physical objects. The human viewer can use their natural physiological mechanisms for depth perception, such as true motion parallax and stereopsis through eye convergence and accommodation, without the need for supplementary hardware. Furthermore, the
