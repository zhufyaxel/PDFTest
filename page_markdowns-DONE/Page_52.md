Pierce et al. explored several different image plane interaction techniques which uses occlusion selection [Pierce et al. 1997]. With the Head Crusher technique, objects which lie between the user’s index finger and thumb are selected (Figure 2-11a). The Sticky Finger technique selects objects by occluding them with the tip of the index finger (Figure 2-11b). The Lifting Palm technique allows users to select objects by flattening their hand and positioning their palm so that it appears to be underneath the object. The last technique was Framing Hands, in which both hands are used to define a bounding box around the object of interest, using the thumbs and index finger.

### 2.6.2.4 3D Cursor

A more direct method of interaction, using a 3D cursor which specifies X, Y and Z coordinates has also been suggested [Hinckley et al. 1994, Mine 1995a, Poupyrev et al. 1996]. Mine distinguishes between local and action-at-a-distance interactions in a virtual world [Mine 1995a]. He states that in local interactions, a direct mapping from the users hand to a 3D cursor should be used to select an object, while selection of objects at a distance, laser beam or spotlight selection could be used. He also suggests that a “virtual cursor or drone” could be moved by the user through the environment until it reaches a distance target for selection.
