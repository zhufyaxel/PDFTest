## 2.4.5 Summary

In this section, we have provided an overview of the evaluations which have been performed on the various 3D display technologies. We have seen that both motion parallax and stereoscopic cues can increase usersâ€™ experiences, both quantitatively and qualitatively. We have also seen that a system which provides only motion parallax and no stereopsis can perform better than a display with only stereopsis and no motion parallax, while a display which provides both will generally provide the best results.

As for volumetric displays, we have presented some early work in their quantitative evaluation. However, our review of the literature revealed little conclusive data on the performance of volumetric displays in comparison to other 3D display techniques for 3D perception tasks. Further work in this area will be required to provide more data in this regard.
 
## 2.5 Three-Dimensional Input Devices

We have discussed the main 3D display technologies which are being used, and the evaluations which have been performed on them. In the remaining sections of this chapter, we will discuss issues related to interacting with these displays.

Three-dimensional displays do not just add a new dimension to visualization; they also present a new dimension for interaction. Although the mouse has strong benefits, which has made it such a successful device in the 2D realm (see [Balakrishnan et al. 1997] for a discussion of these properties), the input device only provides two degrees of freedom. There have been numerous attempts to map the 2D input of the mouse to 3D control, however researchers have also looked at input devices which provide three or more degree-of-freedom input for interacting with three-dimensional displays. In this section, we summarize some of these input devices.
