### 2.6.3.4 Gestural Manipulation

In Charade freehand gestures were used to manipulate 2-dimensional computerized objects in an augmented reality system [Baudel and Beaudouin-Lafon 1993]. Although the gestural interaction was mapped to the manipulation of two-dimensional objects, this could be a valuable method for manipulating three-dimensional objects. Since this foundational work, gestural interfaces have been developed for pen based devices [Zeleznik and Miller 2005], large displays [Vogel and Balakrishnan 2004], and tabletop displays [Wu and Balakrishnan 2003], and could be a valuable method for interaction with volumetric displays.

### 2.6.4 System Control

System control is the set of commands that the user gives to accomplish work within the application. For example, the user may wish to delete an object, or save a model which they are manipulating. In a standard desktop application, system control is achieved through toolbars and menus. Because these widgets are generally 2D, there are interesting challenges involved with integrating them into a 3D environment.

In Mine [1995b], a 2D menu was embedded in the virtual environment. The menu which was developed floats in 3D space and includes various widgets such as radio buttons, sliders, and dials. The user interacts with the menu using a ray cursor, so that the user does not have to make large reaching movements. In the JDCAD system [Liang and Green 1994] a ring menu was used for item selection, where the items were arranged.
