### 2.6.2.5 Silk Cursor

The Silk Cursor [Zhai et al. 1994] is a 3D volume cursor, the extension of 2D area cursors [Kabbash and Buxton 1995]. The silk cursor provides two advantages over a standard point cursor for selection tasks. Firstly, as with 2D area cursors, the effective activation area of a potential target is increased. Secondly, the rectangular shaped silk cursor is lined with a semi-transparent surface, creating a partial occlusion effect (Figure 2-12). This allows users to tell when a target is in front, inside, and behind the silk cursor. In a controlled experiment, the silk cursor was found to be beneficial in both monoscopic and stereoscopic displays.

### 2.6.2.6 Go – Go Technique

Poupyrev [1996] introduced the go-go selection technique to enhance 3D cursor selection for objects at a distance. The technique uses a metaphor of growing a user’s arm interactively, with a non-linear mapping for selecting distant objects. When the user operates on nearby objects, the movement of the virtual hand matches movement of the real hand. To reach remote objects the user simply extends the hand further than 2/3 the length of their arm. The mapping becomes non-linear and the virtual arm grows. Unlike a standard 3D cursor, in which the range of selection is limited to arm’s length, the go-go technique allows for selection of both nearby objects and those at a distance.
