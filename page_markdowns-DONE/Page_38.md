In another implementation, a gaseous volume was enclosed within a sealed glass container. Two diode lasers were intersected in Rubidium vapor [Kim et al. 1996]. The setup requires Rubidium to be heated within a vacuum, making it difficult to design for larger scale display volumes.

A more recent implementation used a pulsed laser to create glowing points of plasma in midair [Uchiyama et al. 2006]. This is one of the few volumetric displays which does not require a physical enclosure. However, the points of plasma are at an extreme temperature, so users are still unable to reach in and interact with the displayed imagery.

Although the current level of quality for static volumetric displays is not up to par with the current generation of rotating swept volumetric displays, their desirable properties make for a promising alternative which researchers continue to develop.

### 2.3.4 Summary

This section has outlined the most common technological implementations for volumetric displays. From an interaction standpoint, these technological differences may not seem so interesting; however, there are some interesting observations to be made. Most importantly, all of the discussed technologies share the properties which we have discussed in Section 1.2.

What is not common among the displays discussed in this section is the shape and size of the physical enclosure. For example, we have seen hemispherical domes, as well as
