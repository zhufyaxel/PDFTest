## 2.2.7 Summary

We have presented a variety of display technologies for three-dimensional data. The displays provide different levels of immersion to the users ranging from non immersive perspective displays to fully immersive head mounted displays. Each display has its own unique properties which afford different methods of interaction. In the next section, we will discuss various volumetric display technologies. By examining and comparing the properties of volumetric displays to the technologies discussed in this section, we will gain an understanding of what interaction techniques will transfer well to volumetric displays, and what interaction techniques will require modifications or enhancements.

## 2.3 Volumetric Displays

Unlike the other display technologies previously discussed volumetric displays present imagery in true 3D space. The viewing space is divided up into 3D pixels, called voxels, which illuminate visible light from the regions which they appear. Because light is emitted in true 3D space, depth cues such as motion parallax and stereopsis will always be present without the need for supplementary hardware. From a technological standpoint, there are some interesting differences between the various implementations of volumetric displays. While they all generate true 3D images, the underlying technology of the various displays vary greatly in both concept and design. From an interaction standpoint, however, these differences will not be so critical, as all of these displays pose the same qualities which we have discussed in Section 1.2. We now provide an overview of the basic classes of 3D volumetric displays.

### 2.3.1 Oscillating Swept Volumetric Displays

A common method for presenting volumetric imagery is to use a two-dimensional image which periodically sweeps out a three-dimensional volume of space. When the space is swept out cyclically at a frequency higher than what the eye can resolve, a spatial image is formed through the persistence of vision. We now discuss the class of displays in which volumes are swept out by oscillating screens.

An early implementation uses a vibrating CRT where the images which output to the screen are synchronized within each oscillation cycle, so that each image appears at the
