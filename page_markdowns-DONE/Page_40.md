## viewpoint conditions, the perspective view was established by the initial head position at the start of the trial.

For each trial of the experiment, subjects were given one of the 10 pair wise comparisons of the 5 viewing conditions. Subjects toggled between the viewing conditions until they made their final selection, as to which was “best”. 

Their results showed no differences between the two scenes so their data was combined. The results showed that users rarely preferred stereo without head coupling over head coupling without stereo. Another interesting result was that users picked head coupling without stereo over head coupling with stereo 68% of the time. The authors attribute this result to the ghosting effect in the stereo conditions, caused by imperfect phosphor decay, which causes cross talk between the left and right images. 

Most importantly, their results supported the use of head coupled stereo viewing. All subjects said that they would use it for object visualization it were available.

## 2.4.2 Empirical Evaluation of Stereo and Motion Cues

The results of the subjective evaluations of three-dimensional viewing modes are unsurprising: providing stereo or motion cues will improve the user’s perception of a three-dimensional scene. Researchers have also tried to quantitatively determine exactly how much is gained by moving from 2D to 3D representations. Ware and Franck note that a completely general answer to this question cannot be expected, because the advantages will greatly depend on the specific task at hand [Ware and Franck 1996]. To gain a preliminary understanding of the issues, researchers have commonly chosen a path tracing task in a network of nodes, of which the results can be generalized to the large set of problems which can be represented in this way [Arthur et al. 1993, Sollenberger and Milgram 1991, Sollenberger and Milgram 1993, Ware et al. 1993, Ware and Franck 1996]. 

It has been shown that stereoscopy can improve user performance when detecting paths in a tree structure [Arthur et al. 1993, Sollenberger and Milgram 1991, Sollenberger and Milgram 1993, Ware and Franck 1996]. Sollenberger and Milgram [1991, 1993] also found that scene rotation further reduced errors in such a path tracing task. In their implementation, scene rotation was controlled by the system. In a follow up study, Ware
